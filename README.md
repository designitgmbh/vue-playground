# vue-playground

> A Vue.js playground to start your large scale client side application with [vue](http://vuejs.org/), [vue-router](http://router.vuejs.org/en/index.html), [vuex](http://vuex.vuejs.org/en/index.html) and [vue-strap](http://yuche.github.io/vue-strap/).

> NOTE: This repository uses webpack as a module bundler

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Purpose

You can create your Laravel, Django, Rails, etc. REST API and then start a completely stand-alone, replaceable, client side application with this simple kick starter scaffold.

The idea behind is to skip configurating all these modules together and have them running out of the box just by typing npm i & npm run dev from the console.

Also, the main purpose of this repo is to play with Vue which is a great frontend framework.

## Collaboration

Send your issues/pull requests thinking that this is a kick starter, not a final polished product. Think what could fit well for the majority of people and if you need some particular scaffold out of the box, I challenge you to fork the repo and do it yourself!

A good pull request would be a vuejs use case where you smashed your brain pulling it off. Then, for the next project, you'll already have it scaffolded in the repo.
